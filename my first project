# WebTools Project

This project is a collection of basic web tools and practice files created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It is designed to help me learn and demonstrate how to build simple web pages and user interfaces.

#Project Structure

- `index.html` – The main homepage.
- `style.css` – The file for styling the web pages.
- `script.js` – JavaScript for interactive features.
- Other `.txt` or `.html` files – Test pages or code experiments.

#Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Practice writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Learn how to use Visual Studio Code for web development
- Understand how to use Git and GitHub to manage code

#How to View

You can open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the page.

#Tools Used

- Visual Studio Code
- Notepad (for some saved files)
- Git and GitHub

All files are created as part of personal learning and practice. Feel free to explore and modify.
